# Diagnosis of Leaf Lesions Using Iris Dataset

## Description

This project explores the application of various data visualization techniques to diagnose and analyze leaf lesions in Iris species. The Iris dataset contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species of Iris flowers: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica. By visualizing these features, we can identify patterns and anomalies that may indicate the presence of leaf lesions.

## Visualizations

The project includes the following visualizations to diagnose leaf lesions:

1. Scatter Plot of Sepal Length vs Sepal Width Colored by Species
2. Boxplot of Sepal Length by Species
3. Boxplot with Individual Points (Stripplot) of Sepal Length by Species
4. Violin Plot of Sepal Length by Species
5. KDE Plot of Sepal Length by Species
6. Pairplot of Iris Dataset Features Colored by Species
7. Pairplot of Iris Dataset Features with KDE on Diagonal
8. Andrews Curves of Iris Dataset
9. Parallel Coordinates Plot of Iris Dataset
10. Radviz Plot of Iris Dataset
